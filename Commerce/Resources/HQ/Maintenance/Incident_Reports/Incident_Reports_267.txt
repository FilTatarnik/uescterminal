Location: BRF 404, Level 4, Bayside Quandrant
Description: A minor water leak was reported in the Level 4 bio-relief facility, caused by a faulty pipe joint. The leak was contained, and repairs initiated, but delays in part acquisition followed by unexpected damage to supply line link assemblage caused delays resulting in prolonged shut down of the facility.
Resolution: Pipe joint replaced, supply line reinforced and assemblage replaced, water damage assessed. Area cleaned and restored.
Comments: Schedule regular plumbing inspections to identify potential issues early. Update parts inventory and acquisition planning to avoid future delays in maintenance facilitation.
