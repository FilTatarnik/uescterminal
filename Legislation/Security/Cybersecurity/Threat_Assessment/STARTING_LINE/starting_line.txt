CASE FILE: [SECURITY CLASSIFIED]
TYPE: Multi-target Threat Assessment
STATUS: [SECURITY CLASSIFIED]
CLASSIFICATION: [SECURITY CLASSIFIED]
EVIDENCE LOGS: [SECURITY CLASSIFIED]

SUMMARY:
External infosec breach compromised vital intelligence related to system-wide security.
Highly-classified details specific to PRO:GO and its target were discovered by non-UESC operatives with intent to disseminate for currently undefined purposes including, but not limited to, anti-UESC activities, recruitment of public, private, and governmental parties into the ranks of known and suspected anti-UESC groups, including, but not limited to MIDA, Traxus OffWorld Industries, and Sekiguchi Genetics.
The extent of any partyâ€™s role remains an active consideration.
Brute force nature of system disruptions makes full accounting of offending parties difficult to define.
UESC netspace security was compromised.
Initial disruption points to MIDA instigation.
Involvement of entities with direct connect and/or operational relations with UESC and UESC sub-branches requires thorough consideration and varied clearance approvals.
All approvals granted.
Investigation underway and unimpeded.
